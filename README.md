## 🎯 Hangman Game in Python

This is a simple command-line **Hangman** game implemented in Python. The player must guess the letters of a hidden word within a limited number of incorrect attempts.

### 🚀 Features

* Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
* Displays the current progress of the word with blanks for unguessed letters.
* Accepts user input and checks for:

  * Valid single alphabet letters.
  * Repeated guesses.
* Provides feedback on correct or incorrect guesses.
* Tracks the number of incorrect attempts (maximum 6).
* Declares a win if the user guesses all letters correctly.
* Declares a loss if the user runs out of attempts.

### 🧠 How It Works

1. A word is randomly selected from the list:

   ```python
   words = ["python", "hangman", "program", "developer", "internship"]
   word_to_guess = random.choice(words)
   ```

2. The player is prompted to guess one letter at a time.

3. The game shows the word with guessed letters revealed and unknown letters as underscores.

4. The game ends with a win or loss message depending on the number of incorrect guesses.

### 📌 Sample Output

```
🎯 Welcome to Hangman!
The word has 8 letters.

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Enter a letter: p
✅ Correct guess!

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ p
...
🎉 Congratulations! You guessed the word: program
```

### 🛠 Requirements

* Python 3.x

No external libraries are needed.

### 📁 How to Run

```bash
